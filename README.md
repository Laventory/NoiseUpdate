# Noise Update FMOD Events Recreation
A recreation of the brand new music and sfx events introduced within The Noise Update (v1.1.0) of [Pizza Tower.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/)
While not 100% accurate I think I got atleast somewhat close to it,  I'm still currently in the process of fixing some mixing issues alongside finding out the *exact* voice clips that play on some events, as I kinda roughballed it in some areas.

# But how do I use these?
You're going to need [FMOD Studio](https://www.fmod.com/) (It's free) and a Pizza Tower FSPRO, what one you use is not important, what is important is that if it's missing the sound effects for the Noise Update you've come to the right place.

I'd recommend checking out my [Egg's Lap Mod FSPRO Events Recreation](https://github.com/Laventory/ELM-Events-Recreation) as it's essientally the same thing.
Just drag the events into your Pizza Tower FSPRO and assign them to their respective banks include them in the sound mixer (CTRL + 5).

I'll update thie readme later on with more information (especially regarding the pizzatime event), but for now this will do.
